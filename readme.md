# 🐍 Blog Post Handler (Python 3.12)

This is the microservice responsible for managing blog posts, optimized for **AWS Lambda** and developed on **macOS (M1)** and **Orange Pi 5 Plus**.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide (For TS/C# Developers)

### 1. Environment Setup (The Python "node_modules")

In Python, we isolate dependencies using a Virtual Environment (`venv`) to avoid polluting the system.

```bash
# 1. Create the environment (First time only)
python3 -m venv venv

# 2. Activate the environment (Do this EVERY time you work!)
# This is like entering the project context
source venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
